# Digit-Recognition-Keras-TF
A small code snippet using the MNIST database for digit recognition, making use of Keras and TensorFlow in Python.

## What is MNIST?

The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.  
It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.

## What is Keras?

Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.  

Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:  
Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).  
Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.  
Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.

## What is Tensorflow?

Tensorflow is an open-source machine learning framework for everyone.  
TensorFlow is an open-source software library for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks. It is used for both research and production at Google, often replacing its closed-source predecessor, DistBelief.  

It was originally developed by the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well. It reached version 1.0 in February 2017, and has continued rapid development, with 21,000+ commits thus far, many from outside contributors. This article introduces TensorFlow, its open source community and ecosystem, and highlights some interesting TensorFlow open sourced models.

TensorFlow is cross-platform. It runs on nearly everything: GPUs and CPUs—including mobile and embedded platforms—and even tensor processing units (TPUs), which are specialized hardware to do tensor math on. They aren't widely available yet, but we have recently launched an alpha program.

## The code workflow

1. Import Tensorflow library   
2. Unpack the dataset  
3. Visulaise the data  
4. Normalise the dataset  
5. Build the model architecture  
6. Make the Deep NN  
7. Train the Deep NN  
8. Evaluate and test the Deep NN  
9. Predict new results.
