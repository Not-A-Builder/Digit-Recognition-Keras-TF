# Digit-Recognition-Keras-TF
A small code snippet using the MNIST database for digit recognition, making use of Keras and TensorFlow in Python.

## What is MNIST?

The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.  
It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.
