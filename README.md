# Digit-Recognition-Keras-TF
A small code snippet using the MNIST database for digit recognition, making use of Keras and TensorFlow in Python.

## What is MNIST?

The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.  
It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.

## What is Keras?

Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.  

Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:  
Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).  
Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.  
Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.
